[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) is an open source cluster computing framework. (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark))

This is a FREE course, to teach you how to use Spark to write programs that get's executed across multiple machines. Whether it is a Simple [Text Search](http://spark.apache.org/examples.html), or something fancy, like calculating [popular Twitter hashtags](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/streaming/TwitterPopularTags.scala).

You can use Python, Java, or Scala to solve course's exercises!

# Who should attend
Students, as well as professionals, who are interested about distributed computing, big data, machine learning, IOT or high scalability.

Whether you are planning for a kickass graduation project, or looking for a new job. This course can introduce you to the tools you need to write server-side distributed code.

## Programming languages
You should be ..  

- Able to write code using Python, Java, or Scala.
- Willing to learn new programming languages! (mostly Scala, some Python)

The course will be mostly using Scala code snippets
(You'll be introduced to Scala basics first), however you will be expected to translate the examples to Python or Java.

# FAQ
1. Q: Who uses Spark?  
A: Check http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/tag/apache-spark

1. Q: How many companies in Egypt uses Spark?  
A: I know about 4, most of them are using Python.

1. Q: Would this course improve my chances of getting a job?  
A: Statistically speaking, there is more PHP jobs than spark/big-data jobs! At least in Egypt.   
I won't say this course is enough. But it is more than a good boost for your skills to continue learning through Coursera, edx and other online eductions websites.

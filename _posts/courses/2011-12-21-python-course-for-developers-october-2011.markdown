I've just finished my Python course, I was very glad to convert .Net developers into opensource world, they seemed to like Python, Thanks to Allah :).  
We covered the basics of python, and it's good practices, conventions and of course Magic. I gave them an fast introduction to  Django, as they were interested in Web Development .  
God bless Open Source, God bless Egypt :).

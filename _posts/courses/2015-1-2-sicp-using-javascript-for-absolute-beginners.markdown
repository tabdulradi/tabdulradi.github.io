This course is about the art of programming, how to think and write beautiful, readable code. This course is not about Javascript details, we are only using Javascript to demonstrate programming concepts that can be applied using other languages too.

#Target Audience
- Either you are completely new to programming or you have some experience but want to improve.
- You want to be a code artist! not just a developer!
- Committed, Committed, Committed! This is not an easy course. You have to be completely free, dedicated and focused.

##Contents
The course is based on the first 3 chapters of [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) and it's [Javascript version](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/sicp/#subsection_1_2_1), in addition to some extra content. The following is highlights of some topics to be discussed in the course.

1. Introduction
  - Where can I use Javascript
  - What is an interpreter
  - Exploring tools
2. Basics of programming (Expressions, Combinations, Abstractions, Conditionals and Predicates)
3. Functions
  - Functions as a way of abstraction
  - What is recursion (Linear, Tree, and Logarithmic)
  - recursion vs loop
4. How to analyse performance and memory consumption of programs
5. Higher order functions, and Closures
5. Immutable Data (Building your own datastructres)
  - Hierarchical Data using Closures
  - Strings
  - Sets
  - Binary Trees
7. Mutable Data (Building your own datastructres)
  - Lists
  - Queues
  - Tables

##Duration
We are going to simulate a real work environment. The course consists of 6 classes, each class is 9 hours long, including breaks.

##Location
The course will be held in Mansoura, Egypt.

##Homework
Exercises in the book are important part of the experience. Your solutions should be published on your [Github](http://github.com) account, so that you can show off your work. Best solution will be merged into the main repo.
If you don't know about Github or Git. Don't worry, I'll introduce them.
